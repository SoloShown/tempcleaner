# TempCleaner
TempCleaner is a simple yet effective program designed to improve the performance of your computer by clearing out unnecessary temporary files. It targets two specific folders: the %temp% folder and the Prefetch folder, which can accumulate a lot of unwanted files over time.

# Features
• Deletes all files in the %temp% folder: The %temp% folder contains temporary files created by the system and applications. Over time, these files can take up unnecessary space and may slow down your computer.

• Clears the Prefetch folder: The Prefetch folder stores information to speed up the loading of applications. However, these files can become outdated and impact system performance if not cleaned regularly.
# How it Works
• Scans and Deletes Files: TempCleaner scans the %temp% and Prefetch folders for any files that are no longer needed.

• Improves Speed: By removing these temporary files, the program helps free up disk space and can potentially improve system speed.
# Usage
Simply run TempCleaner, and it will automatically remove all unnecessary files from both the %temp% folder and the Prefetch folder.
# Benefits
• Increased Disk Space: Free up valuable disk space by deleting unneeded files.

• Improved System Performance: Removing temporary files can help speed up your computer, especially if it has been running for a long time without a clean-up.

⚠️ Possible Temporary Slowdown: Deleting files from the Prefetch folder may cause some applications to load more slowly the first time they are run after the cleanup. This is because the system needs to rebuild the prefetch data for those applications. However, this slowdown is temporary and will not persist after the first launch. ⚠️
